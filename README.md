📌 User Flow Diagram:
1️⃣ User visits the website (CloudFront → S3-hosted frontend).
2️⃣ User logs in via Cognito (IAM-protected authentication).
3️⃣ User browses products (API Gateway → ECS backend → RDS).
4️⃣ User adds items to cart & places an order (ECS → RDS → SNS for notifications).
5️⃣ Payment processing (Third-party API like Stripe/PayPal).
6️⃣ Order status updates & tracking (SQS + Lambda + DynamoDB for event-driven updates).
